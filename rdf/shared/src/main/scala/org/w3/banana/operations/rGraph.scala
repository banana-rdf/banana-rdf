/** an rGraph is one that contains rTriples, which are triples that may contain relative urls.
  * Whereas one can take the union of two arbitrary RDF Graphs, taking the union of two rGraphs is
  * stating that they have the same context. As a result blank nodes from both grahs should not be
  * standardised apart (see
  * [[https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-mt/#shared-blank-nodes-unions-and-merges RDF1.1 semantics]]) Also
  * relative URLs are expected to have the same (unknown) base. Given this difference on the
  * treatment of blank nodes in the union we here choose to define the extension method `+ (t:
  * rTriple[Rdf])` instead.
  *
  * Relative Graphs are especially useful when constructing graphs, when one does not yet know where
  * it will be published. That decision of what the full context will may be one that has to be left
  * to the server, such as on a POST to an LDP Container (see
  * [[https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/#dfn-ldp-server ยง5.2.3.7 of the LDP Spec]]). Resources with relative
  * URLs are also easier to write since one can create nodes like `<#i>` or `<foo/bar>`, that make
  * the relation between resources much easier to understand and to find.
  *
  * Would help if one had a notion of context for rGraphs that would allow them to be related, so
  * that one could not union two graphs that were wrongly related? One could also envisage that one
  * could specify some relations such as a relative path relation `rg1 r(../invoice/) rg2` allowing
  * them to be merged after all after a path adjustment (but this time with blank nodes standardised
  * apart) One could even reason with relative graphs then, so long as the context were fixed. This
  * seems possible, but it looks like a lot of work to think through the details.
  *
  * If we are never going to reason with these graphs, or even query them (which seems likely), then
  * it may be better to introduce a type Stream[rTriple] for constructing graphs, as that construct
  * does not care about standardising bnodes apart and avoids the then unnecessary cost of indexing
  * the triples. Such a construct would also be very useful when reading in graphs that just need to
  * be streamed to a DB. Note that such a stream could do with an optional context URI: if set we
  * have a stream leading to a normal RDF Graph, if not to a stream leading to the structure here.
  * This allows for DBs to perhaps keep track of the original structure of the document.
  *
  * Note that an rGraph will need to have an isomorphism test where a sequence could just compare
  * for triple equality of the sequence, because a graph has no order for the triples. Those are
  * needeed for tests essentially.
