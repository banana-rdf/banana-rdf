/*
 * A VerticeClassification classifies vertices ( BNodes in subject or object position )
 * into more or less specialised groups, such that two nodes in two graphs that are isomorphic belong
 * to the same VerticeClassification. Or equivalently it should never be the case that a node n1 in
 * graph g1 and a node n2 in graph g2, where g1 and g2 are isomorphic, and one of the isomorphic mappings maps
 * n1 to n2, that n1 and n2 belong to to two non equal VerticeClassification.
 *
 * Better implementations will classify Vertices more finely. This can then be used to reduce the search
* space for finding isomorphisms between them, since nodes will only need to other nodes that are part
* of the same VerticeClassification.
*
*  The only methods of interest here are hash and equals

 * It classifies each vertice by the number of certain types of relations it has.
 * WARNING: Do not use in production! Checking isomorphisms with this class on a list with a
 * little duplication can make your machine stall. eg: comparing two graphs each containing the same
 * two lists of length 6 and 5 can lead to a search tree of 65 million. This is better that the full
 * ~ 10 billion search space, but nowhere near small enough to be useful. In comparison the
 * SimpleHashVerticeType brings that down to 64.
 *
 * This is a case class as the case class, as that gives us the equals and hash methods.
 * One could use an immutable Map, but that may be more expensive.
