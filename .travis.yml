# Java flags reasoning, also see https://weblogs.java.net/blog/kcpeppe/archive/2013/12/11/case-study-jvm-hotspot-flags
#
# -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled - effectively adds GC to Perm space.
# -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC       - must be enabled for CMSClassUnloadingEnabled to work
# -XX:MaxPermSize=300M          - In Java 8, this setting is non-mutable and set at 300M - let's be prepared. Also, for Java 7, 
#                                 fixing the actual size is not recommended - see above article 
# 
# SBT Concurrency: 
# By default, SBT runs tasks concurrently and sets the limit of parallel tasks by looking at the number of cores available.
# Note however, that each tasks uses more memory as well, so machines with more cores will need to allocate more memory to SBT.
# On Travis, there is currently 2 cores and so the default SBT java settings are adequate. The rule seems to be to set
# the flag -XmxN, where N = No. cores / 4 - eg with 8 cores(4 real, with hyper threading 8) - -Xmx2048m
