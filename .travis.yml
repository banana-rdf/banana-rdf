# SBT Concurrency:
# By default, SBT runs tasks concurrently and sets the limit of
# parallel tasks by looking at the number of cores available.  Note
# however, that each tasks uses more memory as well, so machines with
# more cores will need to allocate more memory to SBT.  On Travis,
# there is currently 2 cores and so the default SBT java settings are
# adequate. The rule seems to be to set the flag -XmxN, where N =
# No. cores / 4 - eg with 8 cores(4 real, with hyper threading 8) -
# -Xmx2048m
